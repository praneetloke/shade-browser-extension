This browser extension does not collect, use, or store any user information, including IP address or any unique user identifiers.

## Explanation of permissions used by this extension:

> The permissions listed here are not exhaustive but are special permissions that deserve an explanation.

### Local storage

The extension stores data locally in your browser to track which tabs are currently masked when you activate the shade.
The data is cleared automatically when you remove the shade on any tab or close the browser.

### Access to all sites

The extension, by default, requests access to all sites loaded in your browser only for the reason of allowing a user to
pull down the shade (or mask, so to speak) on all tabs regardless of the URL that is loaded. The extension does not access
any content loaded in the tabs themselves.
